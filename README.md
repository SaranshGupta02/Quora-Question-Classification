In this project, I developed a system that classifies whether two  questions are the same, making it easier for users to find relevant answers quickly. This not only enhances the user experience but also improves the efficiency of information retrieval on the platform.

🔍 Key Features:
- Utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing.
- Employs a random forest classifier to accurately determine question similarity.
- Streamlines the process of finding answers to similar questions, saving users time and effort.

💡 Usefulness:
- Enhanced Information Accessibility: Ensures that users can quickly find answers to their questions without sifting through duplicates.
- Improved User Experience: Reduces redundancy by identifying and merging similar questions, making the platform more user-friendly.
- Efficient Information Retrieval: Helps in organizing the vast amount of information on Quora, making it easier to navigate.

🌐 Deployment:
- Deployed the project using the Flask framework, ensuring it is easily accessible and user-friendly.

📚 Technologies Used:
